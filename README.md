# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based **Student Performance Tracker**. It allows teachers to input student names and their scores in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The tracker calculates individual student averages, determines if they are passing or need improvement, and computes the class average.

## Features
- **Add Students**: Add up to three students with their scores.
- **Check Performance**:
  - Calculates each student's average score.
  - Checks if the student is passing (all scores â‰¥ 40).
- **Class Statistics**:
  - Displays the performance of all students.
  - Calculates and displays the class average.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures scores are between 0 and 100.
